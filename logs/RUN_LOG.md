# Recipe Run Log

Human-readable history for recipe-driven work.

Use this file to record what was run, what worked, what failed, and what should
be tested next. Keep entries short. Do not include secrets, real phone numbers,
private emails, or sensitive application notes.

## 2026-06-12 — Added tutorials layer (docs/tutorials/)

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** `data/ats/portals.example.yml`, `scripts/ats/scan.mjs` (usage header, flags, default paths), `package.json`, MYCROFT.md conventions
- **Outputs:** `docs/tutorials/01-first-scan.md` (full predict→run→inspect→judge→record walkthrough with 6 graduated exercises and a what-can-go-wrong table), `docs/tutorials/README.md` (index; tutorials 02–05 marked planned), `DOMAIN.md` first-win section now points to the tutorial
- **Result:** The first-win command is no longer a bare one-liner; a student can complete the scan loop unassisted. Exercise 6 rehearses the attestation format; exercise 4 teaches the conformance/adequacy boundary by deliberate breakage.
- **Open issues:** Sample output numbers in Step 5 are illustrative (live fetch is blocked in this sandbox — could not capture a real success report). Tutorials 02–05 are titles only. Exercise 4's typo-provider behavior was not executed; the tutorial asks the student to discover it, but an instructor should verify the actual error message once on an unrestricted machine.

## 2026-06-12 — First honest run: BLS extract + ATS scan dry-run

- **Recipe:** manual (pre-recipe verification run under MYCROFT.md contract)
- **Inputs:** `scripts/bls/extract-soc-occupation-table.py` against `data/bls/db-30-2-text/` + `data/bls/oesm24nat/`; `npm run ats:scan -- --dry-run` with `REALLOCATION_ENGINE_PORTALS=data/ats/portals.example.yml`
- **Outputs:** `data/bls/compact/soc_occupation_compact.csv` (1,016 occupations; SHA-256 recorded in audit), `data/bls/bls-audit.md` (962/1,016 = 94.7% matched to OEWS 2024 detailed SOC rows)
- **Result:** BLS extractor runs clean after the `Skills.txt` fix; audit generated and read; CSV schema unchanged (`skill_*` columns intact). ATS scan loaded the example portal config, matched the Greenhouse provider, ran filter/dedup/report logic, and wrote nothing in dry-run mode — machinery verified.
- **Open issues:** ATS scan's live fetch failed in the sandboxed environment (network egress blocked) — provider fetch is **not** verified end-to-end; rerun on an unrestricted machine. BLS extractor was not executed pre-fix, so "failed before fix" is inferred from the missing `Recipes.txt` file, not observed. `playwright`/`sharp` not installed; only `js-yaml`/`glob` were needed for this run.

## 2026-06-12 — Fixed rename-shrapnel bugs; added lifecycle frontmatter

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** `scripts/bls/extract-soc-occupation-table.py`, `scripts/ats/analyze-patterns.py`, `scripts/ats/README.md`, 8 core recipe files
- **Outputs:** three one-line fixes (`Recipes.txt`→`Skills.txt`; `modes/RUN_LOG.md`→`logs/RUN_LOG.md` in script and README; audit prose "recipe Level scores"→"skill Level scores"); MYCROFT.md lifecycle frontmatter added to `_shared` (type: contract) and `scan`, `pipeline`, `oferta`, `tracker`, `pdf`, `patterns`, `update` (status: DRAFT, todos_open: 11 each)
- **Result:** Known defects 1–2 from DOMAIN.md closed. Recipe status is now machine-readable.
- **Open issues:** `scripts/cowork-agentic-repo.py` still contains mangled prose ("Recipes and recipes…") — cosmetic, not load-bearing. The 33 non-core recipes have no frontmatter yet.

## 2026-06-11 — Established MYCROFT.md as source of truth

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** architecture review of the full repo; Codex cross-review; Gru SDD; principles discussion (Cowork session)
- **Outputs:** `MYCROFT.md` (new — constitution v0.1.0: 8 principles, verification stack, recipe lifecycle, TODO-closure evidence, attestation format), `DOMAIN.md` (new — domain manifest: actual layout, runnable command surface, known gaps/defects), `CLAUDE.md` (rewritten as pointer to MYCROFT.md), `AGENTS.md` (rewritten as pointer; also removed "recipes, recipes" rename shrapnel)
- **Result:** One governing file; precedence rule explicit; current-vs-planned architecture separated (domain layout is current; `data/raw`/`data/verified`/snickerdoodle CLI marked roadmap). Claude Code named as v0 runtime.
- **Open issues:** Known defects listed in DOMAIN.md §Known gaps: BLS `Recipes.txt` bug, `modes/RUN_LOG.md` path bug, scorer unimplemented, no recipe has a logged run, doctor script not built, person-named recipes need privacy review, skill/recipe terminology in manuscript unreconciled. README and `docs/` not yet updated to cite MYCROFT.md.

## 2026-05-28 — Recipe folder converted to verified-data workflows

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** `recipes/`, `scripts/`, `README.md`, `DATA_CONTRACT.md`
- **Outputs:** `recipes/_shared.md`, `recipes/README.md`, active recipes, and draft/helper recipe files
- **Result:** Recipes now point students toward repo scripts, audits, and logs instead of prompt-only recipes.
- **Open issues:** Some workflows remain intentionally marked as draft until supporting scripts exist.

## 2026-05-28 — Removed copied Job-Ops source tree

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** `data/career-ops-main/`, `scripts/ats/`, `recipes/`, `resumes/`
- **Outputs:** `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `DATA_CONTRACT.md`, provider docs
- **Result:** Removed the copied reference directory after useful pieces had been adapted into maintained repo paths.
- **Open issues:** Provenance now lives in docs and adapted files, not in a local source copy.

## 2026-05-28 — Normalized data directory names

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** old mixed-case 80 Days and BLS data directories, `data/sec/form-d/`
- **Outputs:** `data/80-days-to-stay/`, `data/bls/`, lower-kebab SEC extracted folders, updated docs/scripts
- **Result:** Source/reference data directories now use lower-case kebab-case names. Maintained automation now uses lowercase `scripts/` by repo convention.
- **Open issues:** Some source data filenames and JSON field values still preserve upstream naming.
